Problems
========

Solutions to some programming problems. So far:

	* Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)
	* Universidad de Valladolid Online Judge (UVA)
	* Caribbean Online Judge (COJ)
	* Facebook Hackercup
	* Google Codejam
	* Programando.org

Please don't copy and paste, use them as a guide.

NOTE: Most of the problems were designed to be solved by short algorithms so there are old codes that have lazy variable 
names and/or comments. I'm currently trying to improve that.
